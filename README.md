Beofre using script make sure you have Python 3 installed, it may work with Python 2 but I haven't checked

Steps for using (First tree steps can be done just once and when you setup everything you can just run script when needed)
1. Configure folders you want to clean, put them inside paths list
2. Configure files/folders you want to ignore, you can enter extension, file/folder name or even part of the file/folder name
3. Configre number of days, default is 7, this means that everything odler then 7 days will be deleted
4. Run script
